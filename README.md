# ArtStop
ArtStop is an application that provides information for the ones who are eager to explore cultural centers around the preferred area, in which the results are filtered by the end-user. In addition to that, the candidate areas which are viewed by the end-users will be voted by the other users.  In order to accomplish this, we have also added a User Profile Management system to our project, which will introduce the user voting and commenting features. By doing this, cultural areas with adequate votes will become more reliable and higher voted ares will get more tempting to attract tourists. Furthermore, the voting and commenting system will prevent having wrong information about places on the map. Our system will also suggest places to users by not only processing their current locations but also sorting the places by their popularities.
